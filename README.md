Ever typed a message, stared at it, and thought "that sounds weird"? Omni Text fixes that. It lives quietly in your menu bar, waiting for a hotkey. When you press it, your selected text gets sent to an LLM and replaced with the result — right where you typed it. No copy-pasting. No switching apps. No opening ChatGPT in a browser tab.

## How It Works

```
1. Select text in any application
2. Press your hotkey
3. Text is sent to your LLM provider
4. Rewritten text replaces your selection
5. Cmd+Z to undo if you don't like it
```

That's it. The whole thing takes about a second.

## Real Use Cases

**Fixing embarrassing emails before you hit send** — Select your draft, press `Cmd+Shift+1`, and Omni Text fixes your spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Your coworkers will think you suddenly became meticulous.

**Making Slack messages sound less unhinged** — You typed "pls fix the thing its broken again thx" at 2am. Select it, press `Cmd+Shift+2`, and it becomes "Could you take a look at the issue? It seems to have resurfaced. Thanks!" Crisis averted.

**Translating on the fly** — Create a custom action with a system prompt like "Translate the following text to Japanese. Output only the translation." Now you have a one-hotkey translator that works in any app.

**Simplifying technical jargon** — Writing docs for non-technical stakeholders? Create an action that rewrites text for a general audience. Select the paragraph full of acronyms, hotkey, done.

**Writing commit messages** — Yes, really. Select your messy notes in a text editor, run a custom "Write a concise git commit message from these notes" action, paste it into your terminal.

### Default Actions

| Hotkey | Action | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `Cmd+Shift+1` | **Proofread** | Fix spelling, grammar, and punctuation |
| `Cmd+Shift+2` | **Rewrite** | Rewrite for clarity and readability |

These are just the defaults — you can create as many custom actions as you want, each with its own hotkey and system prompt.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Global Hotkeys** | Trigger actions from any app — no window switching needed |
| **Custom Actions** | Create unlimited rewrite prompts, each with its own hotkey |
| **Multiple Providers** | Configure several LLM providers and switch between them with one click |
| **Any OpenAI-Compatible API** | Works with OpenAI, Anthropic (via proxy), Ollama, LM Studio, Groq, Together AI, Azure OpenAI, or any server that implements the OpenAI chat completions standard |
| **Smart URL Handling** | Just paste your base URL — Omni Text figures out the right endpoint whether you give it `https://api.openai.com`, `https://api.example.com/v1`, or the full path |
| **Menu Bar Native** | Lives in your menu bar with zero Dock presence — it's there when you need it, invisible when you don't |
| **Animated Tray Icon** | A little pixelated cat in your menu bar blinks while processing and looks alarmed when something goes wrong |
| **Privacy Mode** | Toggle off history logging when you're working with sensitive content |
| **Local History** | Searchable SQLite log of every rewrite — see what changed and when |
| **Keychain Storage** | API keys are stored in macOS Keychain, never written to disk |
| **Autosave** | All settings persist automatically as you type — no save buttons anywhere |
| **Always-On Vibrancy** | Translucent glass UI stays beautiful whether the window is focused or not |

## Supported Providers

Omni Text works with **any server that implements the OpenAI chat completions API standard** (`/v1/chat/completions`). This includes:

- **OpenAI** — GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, etc.
- **Groq** — Llama, Mixtral with ultra-fast inference
- **Together AI** — Open-source models hosted in the cloud
- **Ollama** — Run models locally on your Mac
- **LM Studio** — Local model server with a nice UI
- **Azure OpenAI** — Enterprise OpenAI deployments
- **Any OpenAI-compatible server** — If it speaks the OpenAI API format, it works

Configure multiple providers in the **Providers** tab and switch between them with a single click. Use GPT-4o for important emails and a local Llama model for quick proofreading — your call.

## Installation

Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/addison-w/Omni-Text/releases) page.

1. Open the `.dmg` and drag **Omni Text** to Applications
2. Launch it — a cat icon appears in your menu bar
3. Grant **Accessibility** permission when prompted (this is how it reads and replaces your selected text)
4. Go to the **Providers** tab and add your API key
5. Select some text anywhere and press `Cmd+Shift+1` — welcome to the future

### Requirements

- **macOS 13+** (Ventura or later)
- **Accessibility permission** — macOS requires this for apps that read/replace text in other applications
- **An API key** from any OpenAI-compatible provider

## Development
